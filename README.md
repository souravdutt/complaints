# complaints

I've created this web app with a vision, that anyone in the world can find out helpline/complaint contact information of any public/govt/private office by entering location or name of that office.

if someone found any information incorrect they can mark it and also anyone can add comments on each search result.

Also if someone want's to add contact information of any office they can add it. which will be visible in search result after approval of admin.

In admin panel, admin will see list of incorrect infromation marked by visitors in which he can make corrections and also he can view list of new suggestions which he can approve or reject.

# I want everyone to join me to make my vision come true.

# The main challenge behind this is collecting information of all offices around the world.

# If you have any idea or suggestion you're welcome.
